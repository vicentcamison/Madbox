Fun Race 3D similar game

-TIME IT TOOK TO DEVELOP:
I worked during the following intervals: 10:30-11:30; 12:25-14:00; 15:15-17:30 (4h 45min)

-PARTS THAT WERE DIFFICULT, WHY?
FOr me, the concept part was the hardest: coming up with something that could be done in 5 hours that had similar gameplay and feel to Fun Race 3D, and also being able to get everything that was needed in time.

-PARTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER?
Obstacles are not that fun to watch and avoid: they are very simplistic and can fill up the screen and get very noisy. Also, AI just accelerates constantly: never brakes before an obstacle. Right now, it's functional but it's also really easy to win and gets boring pretty quickly.

-A STEP FURTHER
Implement more varied mechanics so that the game doesn't become instantly repetitive, a level generator that places random obstacles and generates infinite levels, and some particles for the rocket thruster and explosion when colliding with an obstacle. In order to expand gameplay, maybe a way to attack other competitors can be developed to make races more exciting.

-WHAT DID YOU THINK?
I've tried to distill Fun Race 3D to its roots and recreate those systems into the game. In order to be able to fit it all in 5h, I decided to change the setting of the game to rocket races so that I could get away with some complex stuff in the game (instead of elaborated challenges a la Takeshi's Castle, this game has moving meteorites that can destroy your spaceship).
